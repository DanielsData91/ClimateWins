# ClimateWins: Machine Learning for Climate Prediction

![ClimateWins](https://github.com/DanielsData91/ClimateWins/blob/main/Master%20Folder%20-%20Project%20ClimateWins/ClimateWins%20-%20Presentation.jpg)

## 📌 Objectives
ClimateWins aims to leverage machine learning to predict the consequences of climate change across Europe and potentially worldwide. This project analyzes data such as:
- Hurricane predictions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S.
- Typhoon data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)
- Global temperature trends
- Various other climate-related datasets

## ❓ Key Questions
1. **How is machine learning used, and is it applicable to weather data?**
2. **Are there any ethical concerns specific to this project?**
3. **What have been the historical maximum and minimum temperatures?**
4. **Can machine learning predict favorable or dangerous weather conditions?**

## 🔬 Hypotheses
We tested our hypotheses using **Regression Analysis** and **Clustering Analysis**:
- **H1: Model Suitability** – Which ML models are best for accurately forecasting extreme weather conditions?
- **H2: Temperature Trends** – Can ML predict significant temperature increases in Europe over the next decade?
- **H3: Correlation Analysis** – What correlations exist between temperature and factors such as the economy, urban landscapes, and air quality?

### 🔹 1. How is machine learning used in weather data analysis?
Machine learning identifies patterns and rules from data to solve problems:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies and predicts outcomes based on proximity between data points.
- **Decision Tree Algorithm:** Uses a hierarchical structure to guide decisions based on input data.
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** A network of interconnected nodes that recognize complex patterns through layered activation.

### 🔹 2. Ethical concerns in machine learning and AI
Machine learning can introduce various ethical issues:
- **Data Privacy:** Weather data should not contain personally identifiable information, such as GPS coordinates (not applicable in this project).
- **Environmental Impact:** Misrepresenting data can lead to decisions that harm ecosystems or biodiversity.
- **Data Accessibility:** Open access to weather data is crucial for preparing for extreme weather events.

### 🔹 3. Historical Temperature Extremes
Based on data from the European Climate Assessment:
- **Lowest Recorded Temperature:** –34.3°C at Sonnblick, Austria (Jan 13, 1968)
- **Highest Recorded Temperature:** 43.6°C in Belgrade, Serbia (July 24, 2007)

### 🔹 4. Can machine learning predict favorable or dangerous weather conditions?
- The **KNN model** achieved an **88% accuracy rate** in predicting whether the weather was pleasant on a given day.

## ✅ Conclusion & Next Steps
### 📌 Conclusion
- The **KNN model** demonstrated **88% accuracy**, making it a strong candidate for weather prediction.
- However, **accuracy varies by location**, indicating a need for further refinement.

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Further **optimization** of machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy.
- Exploring a **combination of supervised and unsupervised learning** for better performance.
- **Expanding the dataset** by incorporating data from additional weather stations to enhance model reliability.
