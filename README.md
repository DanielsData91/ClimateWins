![ClimateWins](https://github.com/DanielsData91/ClimateWins/blob/main/Master%20Folder%20-%20Project%20ClimateWins/ClimateWins%20-%20Presentation.jpg)

# Introduction
## Objectives
- **ClimateWins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world.**
- **It’s been sorting through hurricane predictions from The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S., typhoon data from The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in Japan, world temperatures, and a great deal of other data.**

## Key Questions
- **1: How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?**
- **2: ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?**
- **3: Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?**
- **4: Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)**

## Hypothesis 
Hypotheses were tested using Regression Analysis and Clustering Analysis:

- **Hypothesis 1 Caputure:** Which machine learning models are suitable for accurate forecasting extreme weather conditions?
- **Hypothesis 2 Temperature** Can machine learning predict significant temperature increases in Europe over the next decade?
- **Hypothesis 3 Correlation:** What correlations can be identified between temperature and variables like economy, cityscape, and air quality?

## 1. Project Description
As a data analyst for this project, I conducted an analysis to test whether machine learning modules are capable of predicting future weather conditions. I tested different MLMs like KNN, Decision Tree, and ANNs to determine the highest accuracy among these supervised machine learning algorithms.

### 3.1 How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?

Machine learning algorithms work inductively, identifying patterns and rules from data to solve problems.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies and predicts groupings based on the  proximity between data points.

Decision Tree Algorithm: Uses a hierarchical structure to guide decisions based on input data.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN): A network of interconnected nodes that recognize deeper patterns through layered activation.

### 3.2 ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?

Ethical Issues can exist in various natures:
Data Privacy: Weather data should not include personally identifiable information like GPS data (not applicable in this project).

Environmental Impact: Misrepresenting data can lead to decisions that harm ecosystems or biodiversity.

Data Accessibility: Ensuring open access to weather data is crucial for preparedness during extreme weather events.

### 3.3 Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
Based on the European Climate Assessment dataset:
Minimum Temperature: -34.3ºC at Sonnblick on January 13, 1968
Maximum Temperature: 43.6ºC at Belgrade on July 24, 2007.


### 3.4 Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)
The MLM K-Nearest Neigbor (KNN) was able to predict to an average pf 88% that the weather was plesent during a certain day.

## 4. Conclusion & Next Steps
Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:

### 4.1 Conclusion:
The KNN model achieved an average accuracy of 88%, making it a strong candidate for weather prediction. However, accuracy varies by location.

### 4.2 Next Steps:
Further optimizing machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy.
Exploring a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning for better performance.
Expanding the dataset by incorporating data from additional weather stations to enhance model reliability.
