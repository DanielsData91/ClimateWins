# CareerFoundry Project: ClimateWins

![Brazil](https://github.com/DanielsData91/Brazilian-E-Commerce-Analysis/blob/main/Visualizations/E-Commerce.jpg)

# Introduction
## Objectives
- **ClimateWins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world.**
- **It’s been sorting through hurricane predictions from The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S., typhoon data from The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in Japan, world temperatures, and a great deal of other data.**

## Key Questions
- **1: How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?**
- **2: ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?**
- **3: Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?**
- **4: Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)**

## Hypothesis 
Hypotheses were tested using Regression Analysis and Clustering Analysis:

- **Hypothesis 1 Caputure:** Which machine learning models are suitable for accurate forecasting extreme weather conditions?
- **Hypothesis 2 Temperature** Can machine learning predict significant temperature increases in Europe over the next decade?
- **Hypothesis 3 Correlation:** What correlations can be identified between temperature and variables like economy, cityscape, and air quality?

## 1. Project Description
As a data analyst for this project, I conducted an analysis to test whether machine learning modules are capable of predicting future weather conditions. I tested different MLMs like KNN, Decision Tree, and ANNs to determine the highest accuracy among these supervised machine learning algorithms.

## 4. Hypothesis

- **Hypothesis 1:** If shipping time is higher, then the shipping duration is higher?

![TimeVSDuration](https://github.com/DanielsData91/Brazilian-E-Commerce-Analysis/blob/main/Visualizations/timevsduration.png)

**Interpretation of the Regression Model Fit:**

The first observation is that the regression line covers a relatively small number of data points, as most of the points are concentrated around higher y-axis values. Additionally, there is a large cluster of points around a shipping time of -50 to +50 days and a shipping duration of 0-50 days. Despite this concentration, the regression line shows a strong positive correlation, which will be further explored later.

![TimeVSDuration](https://github.com/DanielsData91/Brazilian-E-Commerce-Analysis/blob/main/Visualizations/Hypothesis%201.png)

**Thought:**

- There is a positive relationship between shipping time and shipping duration, though the relationship is weak (R² = 0.38).
- The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is quite high, indicating that predictions deviate significantly from actual values.
- The linear regression model does not capture the complexity of the data well, and the presence of negative predictions is a red flag.
- Further investigation into other features (e.g., distance, product type, region) or experimenting with different models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) could improve predictive power.

- **Hypothesis 2:** If the price is higher, then the freight value is higher?
  
![PrceVSFreight](https://github.com/DanielsData91/Brazilian-E-Commerce-Analysis/blob/main/Visualizations/pricevsfreight.png)

**Interpretation of the Regression Model Fit:**

The regression line covers only the middle range of the scatter plot, spanning freight values from 13 to prices around 250. The line suggests a positive correlation between price and freight value.

![Hypothesis 2](https://github.com/DanielsData91/Brazilian-E-Commerce-Analysis/blob/main/Visualizations/Hypothesis%202.png)

**Thought:**
- Low predictive power: The R² score is low, indicating that "Price" alone is not a strong predictor of "Freight Value." Other important variables may be missing from the model.
- Potential improvements: Including additional variables, such as product category, shipping distance, or order size, could improve the model’s accuracy. Alternatively, exploring more complex models might help capture any non-linear relationships.

- **Hypothesis 3:** If the estimated duration is higher, then the freight value is higher??

![EstiDurationVSFreight](https://github.com/DanielsData91/Brazilian-E-Commerce-Analysis/blob/main/Visualizations/estivsduration.png)

**Interpretation of the Regression Model Fit:**

The regression line fits many of the data points in the cluster, but a more detailed statistical summary will provide a clearer interpretation.

![Hypothesis 3](https://github.com/DanielsData91/Brazilian-E-Commerce-Analysis/blob/main/Visualizations/Hypothesis%203.png)

**Thought:**
- Modest predictive power: The R² score of 0.208 suggests a weak relationship between the Estimated Duration Days and Freight Value.
- The model might benefit from incorporating additional variables to enhance its accuracy

## 5. Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:

- **Focus on High-Value States:** Prioritize expanding in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais due to high revenue potential.
- **Leverage High Lifetime Value Customers:** Engage top customers in Praia Grande, Niterói, and Belo Horizonte with loyalty programs and targeted offers.
- **Optimize Top-Selling Categories:** Strengthen product offerings in Bed Bath Table, Computers Accessories, and Health Beauty categories.
- **Improve Delivery Communication:** Capitalize on early deliveries by promoting reliable and fast delivery as a competitive advantage.
- **Maintain Customer Satisfaction:** Continue focusing on product quality and service to maintain positive reviews and strengthen customer loyalty.
- **Explore Seasonal Promotions:** Investigate causes of sales dips in June-July and develop promotional campaigns to counteract this trend.

---

## 6. Next Steps
- **Detailed Market Analysis:** Conduct a deeper regional analysis focusing on customer preferences and local competition.
- **Customer Retention Strategies:** Implement targeted marketing campaigns and loyalty programs for high-value customers.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Investigate logistics partners and processes to maintain or improve early delivery performance.
- **Product Expansion:** Evaluate potential for expanding high-performing categories into underpenetrated regions.
- **Seasonality Research:** Further investigate the June-July sales dip to determine underlying causes and refine promotional strategies accordingly.
